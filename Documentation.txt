HTML

To-Do List, Widget_3: Weather,Widget_4: News.
Widgets can be added and/or deleted. 

DESIGN CHOICES
- Navigation bar was included for an enhanced visual user experience.
- Each widget structured with a heading, content area, and three-dots icon for potential 
settings. Widgets have a dark background with white text for better readability.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN
- Employs Bootstrap for enhancing visual elements, including a variety of icons, 
contributing to a more stylish appearance and a visually appealing dashboard.
- Custom CSS styles have been applied strategically to further enhance and refine 
the overall visual presentation of the web page.

DARK MODE
- Includes a dark mode toggle button (changeMode()) that not only changes the body's 
background to a dark color but also adapts the color scheme of widgets, providing a 
cohesive dark mode experience throughout the dashboard.

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES/TOOLS
- Bootstrap
Primarily employed for its rich set of icons and aesthetic enhancements, Bootstrap adds 
a visual appeal to the dashboard. While it simplifies the integration of icons, its usage 
extends to refining the overall look and feel of the site. The preference for Bootstrap stems 
from its simplicity in incorporating attractive visual elements, contributing to an enhanced 
and visually pleasing user interface.
